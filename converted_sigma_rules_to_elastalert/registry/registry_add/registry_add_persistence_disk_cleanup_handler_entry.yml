  Detects when an attacker modifies values of the Disk Cleanup Handler in the registry to achieve persistence.
  The disk cleanup manager is part of the operating system. It displays the dialog box [â€¦]
  The user has the option of enabling or disabling individual handlers by selecting or clearing their check box in the disk cleanup manager's UI.
  Although Windows comes with a number of disk cleanup handlers, they aren't designed to handle files produced by other applications.
