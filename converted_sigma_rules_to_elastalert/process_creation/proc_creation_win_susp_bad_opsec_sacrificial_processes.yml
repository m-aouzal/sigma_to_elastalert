  Detects attackers using tooling with bad opsec defaults.
  E.g. spawning a sacrificial process to inject a capability into the process without taking into account how the process is normally run.
  One trivial example of this is using rundll32.exe without arguments as a sacrificial process (default in CS, now highlighted by c2lint), running WerFault without arguments (Kraken - credit am0nsec), and other examples.
