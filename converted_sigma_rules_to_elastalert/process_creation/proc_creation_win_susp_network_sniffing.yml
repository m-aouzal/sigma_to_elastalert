  Detects potential network sniffing via use of network tools such as "tshark", "windump".
  Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection.
  An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.
