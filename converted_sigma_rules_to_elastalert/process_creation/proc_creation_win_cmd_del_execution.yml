description: |
  Detects execution of the builtin "del"/"erase" commands in order to delete files.
  Adversaries may delete files left behind by the actions of their intrusion activity.
  Malware, tools, or other non-native files dropped or created on a system by an adversary may leave traces to indicate to what was done within a network and how.
  Removal of these files can occur during an intrusion, or as part of a post-intrusion process to minimize the adversary's footprint.
