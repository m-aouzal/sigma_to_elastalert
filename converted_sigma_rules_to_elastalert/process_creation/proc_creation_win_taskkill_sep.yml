  Detects one of the possible scenarios for disabling Symantec Endpoint Protection.
  Symantec Endpoint Protection antivirus software services incorrectly implement the protected service mechanism.
  As a result, the NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM user can execute the taskkill /im command several times ccSvcHst.exe /f, thereby killing the process belonging to the service, and thus shutting down the service.
