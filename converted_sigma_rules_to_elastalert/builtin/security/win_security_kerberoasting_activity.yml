  This rule will collect the data needed to start looking into possible kerberoasting activity.
  Further analysis or computation within the query is needed focusing on requests from one specific host/IP towards multiple service names within a time period of 5 seconds.
  You can then set a threshold for the number of requests and time between the requests to turn this into an alert.
