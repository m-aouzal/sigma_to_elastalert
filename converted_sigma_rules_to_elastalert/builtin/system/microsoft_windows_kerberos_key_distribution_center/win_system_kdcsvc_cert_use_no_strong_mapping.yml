  Detects a user certificate that was valid but could not be mapped to a user in a strong way (such as via explicit mapping, key trust mapping, or a SID)
  This could be a sign of exploitation of the elevation of privilege vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-34691, CVE-2022-26931, CVE-2022-26923) that can occur when the KDC allows certificate spoofing by not requiring a strong mapping.
  Events where the AccountName and CN of the Subject do not match, or where the CN ends in a dollar sign indicating a machine, may indicate certificate spoofing.
